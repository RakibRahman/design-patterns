# Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
Ensure that only one instance of the class exists by using the `object` declaration in kotlin.
The Singleton pattern is crucial because it helps you manage shared resources more efficiently. For example, think of scenarios like logging, configuration settings, or database connections â€” these are areas where you typically need only one instance.


# Factory Pattern
The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but it allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Instead of calling a constructor directly to create an object, the client calls a factory method defined by an abstract class or interface, which delegates the process to derived classes. This approach promotes loose coupling and adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, allowing a system to be extended without modifying existing code.

# Abstract Factory pattern 
A design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The Abstract Factory pattern is a way to create families of related objects without having to specify their exact classes. Think of it as a "factory for factories."

Key Points
    Creates Families of Objects: Instead of creating a single object (like one button), this pattern is designed to create a whole set of objects that are meant to work together. For example, it could create a button, a checkbox, and a window that all share the same visual style (e.g., a "dark mode" theme).

    Uses Composition: It delegates the job of creating objects to other, more specialized factory objects. Imagine a BuilderPattern.AbstractFactoryPattern.FactoryPattern.main furniture factory (the Abstract Factory) that doesn't make furniture itself. Instead, it has contracts with a "Modern Style" factory and a "Vintage Style" factory. When you want a modern chair, you ask the BuilderPattern.AbstractFactoryPattern.FactoryPattern.main factory, and it tells the modern factory to make it for you.

    Manages Complexity: This pattern is perfect for systems that need to support multiple "themes" or configurations. For instance, an application that can switch between a Windows look, a macOS look, and a Linux look would use an abstract factory to ensure all UI elements match the chosen operating system's style.

    Enhances Scalability: Adding a new family of objects is easy. If you wanted to add a "futuristic" theme to your UI, you would simply create a new "futuristic factory" without having to change the existing code that requests the UI elements.

# Builder Pattern
A creational pattern that helps you construct complex objects, step by step, in a readable and manageable way. Its  simplifies the creation of complex objects.
