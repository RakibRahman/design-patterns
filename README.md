# Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
Ensure that only one instance of the class exists by using the `object` declaration in kotlin.
The Singleton pattern is crucial because it helps you manage shared resources more efficiently. For example, think of scenarios like logging, configuration settings, or database connections â€” these are areas where you typically need only one instance.
